# Agents

Use this document to track automation and custom agents related to the Vico project.

For context and instructions for coding agents, see the project guidance at https://agents.md. Capture any project-specific guidance here, including:
- When and how the agent should be invoked.
- Inputs the agent expects and outputs it produces.
- Constraints, safeguards, and escalation paths.

## How to add an agent

For each agent, include:
1. **Name** – the agent’s identifier.
2. **Purpose** – what the agent is responsible for.
3. **Owner** – who maintains or monitors the agent.
4. **Notes** – any setup details or links to relevant resources.
