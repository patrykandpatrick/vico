# Learning resources

## Guide

This guide serves as an overview, outlining Vico’s core features and providing usage guidance.

## API reference

[The API reference](https://api.vico.patrykandpatrick.com/) describes every public API element. On each of the guide’s pages, the first mention of any class, function, or property is a link to the corresponding page in the API reference. Follow these links to learn about all the features of the APIs described, as well as more APIs.

## Sample app

Included in the repository is [a sample app](https://github.com/patrykandpatrick/vico/tree/stable/sample), which consists of sample charts. There are modules with sample charts for both supported UI frameworks:

* [`sample:compose`](https://github.com/patrykandpatrick/vico/tree/stable/sample/compose/src/main/kotlin/com/patrykandpatrick/vico/sample/compose) (Compose Multiplatform)
* [`sample:views`](https://github.com/patrykandpatrick/vico/tree/stable/sample/views/src/main/kotlin/com/patrykandpatrick/vico/sample/views) (Android view system)

The sample app is the most practical Vico learning resource, recommended for beginner and advanced users alike. Sample charts are referenced throughout the guide.

Follow the links above to view the code on GitHub. For Android, you can also [download the APK](https://github.com/patrykandpatrick/vico/releases/download/v3.0.0/android-sample-debug.apk). To work with the sample app locally, clone the repository, switch to the right tag, open the project in Android Studio, and navigate to the [`sample`](https://github.com/patrykandpatrick/vico/tree/stable/sample) module.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/patrykandpatrick/vico
cd vico
git checkout v3.0.0
```
