# Contributing

## Issues and discussions

* To report a bug or a documentation error, [open an issue](https://github.com/patrykandpatrick/vico/issues/new/choose).
* To ask a question or share an idea, [start a discussion](https://github.com/patrykandpatrick/vico/discussions/new/choose).

## Pull requests

For pull requests, follow these guidelines:

* Use `master` as the base branch.
* To format your code, use [`ktfmt`](https://facebook.github.io/ktfmt/) with `--google-style`. For matters not handled thereby, follow the conventions described on the [“Coding conventions”](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html) page of the Kotlin documentation.
* Add documentation for all public API elements.
