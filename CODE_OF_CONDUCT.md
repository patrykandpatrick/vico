# Contributor Covenant 3.0 code of conduct

## Our pledge

We pledge to make our community welcoming, safe, and equitable for all.

We are committed to fostering an environment that respects and promotes the dignity, rights, and
contributions of all individuals, regardless of characteristics including race, ethnicity, caste,
color, age, physical characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or
expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or social origin,
socioeconomic position, level of education, or other status. The same privileges of participation
are extended to everyone who participates in good faith and in accordance with this code of conduct.

## Encouraged behaviors

While acknowledging differences in social norms, we all strive to meet our community’s expectations
for positive behavior. We also understand that our words and actions may be interpreted differently
than we intend based on culture, background, or native language.

With these considerations in mind, we agree to behave mindfully toward each other and act in ways
that center our shared values, including

1. respecting the **purpose of our community** and our activities,
2. engaging **kindly and honestly** with others,
3. respecting **different viewpoints** and experiences,
4. **taking responsibility** for our actions and contributions,
5. gracefully giving and accepting **constructive feedback**,
6. committing to **repairing harm** when it occurs, and
7. behaving in other ways that promote and sustain the **well-being of our community**.

## Restricted behaviors

We agree to restrict the following behaviors in our community. Instances, threats, and promotion of
these behaviors are violations of this code of conduct.

1. **harassment**: violating explicitly expressed boundaries or engaging in unnecessary personal
   attention after any clear request to stop
2. **character attacks**: making insulting, demeaning, or pejorative comments directed at a
   community member or group of people
3. **stereotyping or discrimination**: characterizing anyone’s personality or behavior on the basis
   of immutable identities or traits
4. **sexualization**: behaving in a way that would generally be considered inappropriately intimate
   in the context or purpose of the community
5. **violating confidentiality**: sharing or acting on someone’s personal or private information
   without their permission
6. **endangerment**: causing, encouraging, or threatening violence or other harm toward any person
   or group
7. behaving in other ways that **threaten the well-being** of our community

### Other restrictions

1. **misleading identity**: impersonating someone else for any reason or pretending to be someone
   else to evade enforcement actions
2. **failing to credit sources**: not properly crediting the sources of content you contribute
3. **promotional materials**: sharing marketing or other commercial content in a way that is outside
   the norms of the community
4. **irresponsible communication**: failing to responsibly present content that includes, links, or
   describes any other restricted behaviors

## Reporting an issue

Tensions can occur between community members even when they are trying their best to collaborate.
Not every conflict represents a code-of-conduct violation, and this code of conduct reinforces
encouraged behaviors and norms that can help avoid conflicts and minimize harm.

When an incident does occur, it is important to report it promptly. To report a possible violation,
[contact the maintainers](mailto:contact@patrykandpatrick.com).

The maintainers take reports of violations seriously and will make every effort to respond in a
timely manner. They will investigate all reports of code-of-conduct violations and will keep
investigation and enforcement actions as transparent as possible while prioritizing safety and
confidentiality.

## Addressing and repairing harm

If an investigation by the maintainers finds that the code of conduct has been violated, the
maintainers will exercise their discretion and judgement to take appropriate action. This may
include warnings, temporary restrictions, or permanent bans, in keeping with the best interests of
our community.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies within all community spaces.
